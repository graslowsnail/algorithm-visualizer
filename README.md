# Algorithm Visualizer 🔥

Yoo select an algo to visualize! This is an interactive web app that helps you understand sorting algorithms through visual animations.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Check it out: [https://algorithm-visualizer-iota-one.vercel.app/](https://algorithm-visualizer-iota-one.vercel.app/)

## 📚 Algorithms Included

- **Insertion Sort** - Takes each element and finds the correct position in the already-sorted portion
- **Bubble Sort** - Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in wrong order

## 🛠️ Built With

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Deployed on Vercel

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations** - Watch algorithms work step by step
- **Clean UI** - Simple, focused interface for learning
- **Algorithm Info** - Learn about time complexity and how each algorithm works
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 🎓 Learning Focus

This project was built to understand algorithms from the ground up - no copy-pasting, just pure logic and understanding. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed comments explaining every step.

## 🔥 What's Next?

- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort  
- Merge Sort
- Binary Search
- And more algorithms to come!
